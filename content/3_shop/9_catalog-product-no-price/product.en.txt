Productdescription: [{"content":{"text":"<p>This Modern Leisure Chair is a premium reproduction of one of the most classic designs from the mid-century modern era. A rare combination and its misleadingly complex construction stem from the designer's extensive knowledge of wood. </p><p>The fluid lines and minimalist style create an airy feel while the Y-back creates a truly organic impression. The Modern Leisure Chair design starts with a semi-circle back that integrates into the highly curved rear legs. Four horizontal crossbars are placed below the seating platform. </p><p>The 2 side crossbars are of even height while the front is placed on a slightly higher plane and the back is placed lower. The back of the chair features the signature \"Y\" feature. It is flat in shape and designed with back comfort in mind. The seat is handwoven with natural rattan providing a comfortable long-lasting platform. 3 coats of polyurethane finish the surface. </p><p>This chair is often used as a dining chair, occasional chair, and home office chair.</p>","textalign":"","textaligntablet":"","textalignmobile":"","textsize":"","texttransform":"","textwrapping":"","textcolor":""},"id":"efb4bbd1-8d8f-4fc0-8655-abbc8bdfaece","isHidden":false,"type":"text"}]
